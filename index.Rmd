<font size="3">Hello! I'm a PhD student studying Public Policy at the University of Chicago. My research focuses on examining ways to reduce inequality and eliminate barriers to education; particularly for women, first-generation college students, and other historically disadvantaged groups. Currently, I am studying the effects of statewide higher education policies on the academic outcomes of community college students, as well as changes in gender and racial representation in children's books over time.   

I am a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/inclusiveeconomy">Inclusive Economy Lab</a> as well as a Doctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://cdac.uchicago.edu/fellows-and-scholars/">Center for Data and Computing</a> and a <a href="https://voices.uchicago.edu/coed/coe-fellows-2020/">Committee on Education</a> Fellow at UChicago.
